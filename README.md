Indian farmers face numerous challenges, including limited market access, price manipulation by middlemen, inefficient resource allocation, and unstable incomes due to fluctuating crop prices. This AI-driven platform aims to solve these problems by:

- **Direct Market Access**: Connecting farmers directly with buyers, eliminating middlemen, and ensuring fair prices.
- **Fair Farm Price (FFP) Model**: Offering returns above the Minimum Support Price (MSP), while factoring in inflation and global exchange rates, protecting farmers from price volatility.
- **Optimized Resource Allocation System**: Using buyer advances to provide farmers access to shared resources like tractors and fertilizers, boosting efficiency without high upfront costs.
- **Interactive Farmer Awareness Portal**: Offering real-time insights on market trends, weather forecasts, crop recommendations, and best practices, empowering farmers to make informed decisions.

Through this integrated approach, the platform seeks to improve farmer profitability, ensure sustainable incomes, and reduce traditional farming risks.

### Workflow

The trader submits crop requirements to the government, which allocates farmlands to farmers based on previous soil data and regional crop details, using Graph Neural Networks and K-Means Clustering for optimized resource allocation. A bidding system is initiated where traders bid on or above the Fair Farm Price. After the cropping season, crops are handed over to government warehouses, and a distribution system is optimized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming for efficient supply chain management.
